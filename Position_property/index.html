        <h1>CSS Layout - The position Property</h1>
        <p> The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed,
            absolute or
            sticky).</p>
        <h4>The position Property : </h4>
        <p> The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
            There are five different position values:
        <ul>
            <li>static</li>
            <li>relative</li>
            <li>fixed</li>
            <li>absolute</li>
            <li>sticky</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties
            will not work
            unless the position property is set first.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sticky">I am sticky!</div>
    <div>
        <h1>position: static;</h1>
        <p>HTML elements are positioned static by default.

            Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

            An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to
            the normal
            flow of the page:</p>
        <div class="static">
            This div element has position: static;
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>position: relative;</h1>
        <p> An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

            Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be
            adjusted away
            from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
        </p>
        <div class="relative">
            This div element has position: relative;
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1> position: fixed;</h1>
        <p> An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the
            same place
            even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
            A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
        </p>
        <div class="fixed">
            This div element has position: fixed;
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1> position: absolute;</h1>
        <p>
        An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned
        relative to the viewport, like fixed).
        However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with
        page scrolling.
        </p>
        <div class="relative1">This div element has position: relative;
            <div class="absolute1">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h1> position: sticky;</h1>
        <p> An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
        A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a
        given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
        </p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Overlapping Elements</h1>
        <p> When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.
        The <strong>z-index</strong> property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the
        others).
        An element can have a positive or negative stack order:
        </p>
        <div>
            <h1>This is a heading</h1>
            <img src="./image.jpg" width="100" height="140">
            <p>Because the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behind the text.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
