/* CSS Layout - The display Property */
/* The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout. */

/* The display Property
The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.
Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline. */

/* Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). */
/* <div>
<h1> - <h6>
<p>
<form>
<header>
<footer>
<section> */


/* Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. */


/* Display: none;
display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. Take a look at our last example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.*/

.block{
    width: 300px;
    display: inline-block;
